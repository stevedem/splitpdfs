# splitpdfs
A simple Python Function App that splits multi-page PDFs into single-page PDFs.

This Function App is integrated into a Logic App. You can find more detail regarding the Logic App on my personal blog located here: http://www.stevedem.com/splitting-pdfs-with-a-logic-app-and-a-python-function/
